List of Supported Algorithms
============================

The following nature-inspired algorithms are currently supported by :doc:`NatureInspiredSearchCV </introduction/nature-inspired-search-cv>` (use its shorthand as the algorithm value). 
If you would like to use other algorithms (or the same, but with the different parameters) refer to :doc:`Using a Custom NiaPy Algorithm </advanced/niapy>`.
